# **Joris Wilson: CPE 517 - Digital and Computer Systems Architecture**
# ***This course is still ongoing***

## This repo will contain all related files and notes to CPE 517, a graduate course at Stevens Institute of Technology

## COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course introduces students to computer architecture and the design of efficient computing
and memory systems. The key topics of this course include efficiency metrics (performance,
power, energy, and cost), Instruction set choices for C++ code, organization of a simple
processor (data path, control path, and 5-stage pipelining), hardware/software interface
(Instruction, data and thread level parallelism), memory hierarchy and the performance of cache
organizations.
